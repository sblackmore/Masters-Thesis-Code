% pass through the 1/12 octave bands to look at noise in different octaves
% need to filter them and store the results

% filter the convolved signal through the 1/12 octave bands
% need to have center frequencies for each pitch (i.e., 12 sets of center
% frequencies within the range we care about



% need take the convolved signal and deconvolve it from every amp and store
% the result.  Then analyze the results to try and determine the clean
% guitar by analyzing features like noise, wetness, etc.  Can then use that
% to determine the amplifier form the guitar.
